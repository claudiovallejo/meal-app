# Meal Plan Generator
Over the weekend (Fri Mar 3 -> Sun Mar 5) my brother and I worked on a simple site that generates random, daily meal plans. My brother is currently following a specific diet and the diet is composed of a very limited set of foods. My brother came up with the idea of creating a site/app that randomly selected a meal to automate his meal selection process and to make his diet less monotonous.

This project is currently a simple static site built with HTML/CSS/JS. My brother's meal plan is stored in a JSON file that feeds the site's content. Unfortunately the site doesn't save any data, so it makes the site quite useless right now. I've been doing some research about service workers to store the site's data on the device, which would make the app useful.

I learned several new things while building the app, and building this app peaked my curiosity to build a more complex app where my brother can add new meals through the app, save favorite meal plans, among other things. I'll be learning the MEAN stack and some React along the way, so I'll be building the app's features as time goes on.
