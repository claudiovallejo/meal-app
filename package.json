  "description": "Over the weekend (Fri Mar 3 -> Sun Mar 5) my brother and I worked on a simple site that generates random, daily meal plans. My brother is currently following a specific diet and the diet is composed of a very limited set of foods. My brother came up with the idea of creating a site/app that randomly selected a meal to automate his meal selection process and to make his diet less monotonous.",
