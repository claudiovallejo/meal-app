My brother is currently following a specific diet and the diet is composed of a very limited set of foods. My brother came up with the idea of creating a site/app that randomly selected a meal to automate his meal selection process and to make his diet less monotonous.</p>\n<p>This project is currently a simple static site built with HTML/CSS/JS. My brother&apos;s meal plan is stored in a JSON file that feeds the site&apos;s content. Unfortunately the site doesn&apos;t save any data, so it makes the site quite useless right now. I&apos;ve been doing some research about service workers to store the site&apos;s data on the device, which would make the app useful.</p>\n<p>I learned several new things while building the app, and building this app peaked my curiosity to build a more complex app where my brother can add new meals through the app, save favorite meal plans, among other things.</p>\n<h1>Personalizing the App</h1>\n<p>If you&apos;re interested in having the app generate random meals based on your diet, follow the next 5 steps&#x2014;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Clone the repository</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Update <code>data/meals.json</code> with your own meals</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In <code>scripts/app.js</code> update <code>mealTypes</code> and <code>mealGuide</code>. <code>mealTypes</code> is a list of the available meal types. <code>mealGuide</code> defines the order and type of meals the generator creates for your daily meals.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Update the <code>XMLHttpRequest().open</code> path in <code>scripts/app.js</code>. I&apos;m currently using GitHub&apos;s raw data file path (you find this path after cloning the project and hosting on your GitHub account, opening the project&apos;s <code>data/meals.json</code> file, and selecting &apos;Raw&apos; next to the &apos;Blame&apos; and &apos;History&apos; buttons.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Publish site</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>PS &#x2014; I highly recommend hosting on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>. All you have to do is create an account, create a new project, and link the GitHub repo with your Netlify project. The site will automatically update with <code>git push origin master</code>.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or suggestions let me know <a href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop\">@claudiovallejop</a>.</p>\n<h1>Sample Meal API</h1>\n<pre>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;name&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;Banana Pancakes&quot;</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;type&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;Breakfast&quot;</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;macros&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;fat&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">15.50</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;protein&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">34.00</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;carbs&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">21.00</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;ingredients&quot;</span>: [\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;1 Tbsp of Peanut Butter&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;1 Cup of Almond Milk&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;33g of Whey Protein&quot;</span>\n  ]\n}</pre>"
